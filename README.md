# basketball_court_threejs

Project for modeling the Portland Trail Blazers court using Three.js

# Motivation
I'm a huge basketball fan and I love/hate the Trail Blazers, so I decided to attempt to "replicate" the court/arena they play in using a graphics tool I've learned about from class.


# Process
I initially started the project using OpenGL (C++). Getting my environment setup the way I wanted it to on Windows was very frustrating. Eventually, having things setup in a satisfactory way, I realized that OpenGL would take me way too long to get things on the screen, so I looked for an alternative.

I've known about Three.js for a while, but I'd never used it. Listened to a lecture in class about it and decided to make the switch, which was a great decision.

# Viewing
I realize that I've had to always run a local server using a VS Code extension to actually view my Three.js + HTML, as I run into a CORS issue trying to load a local JavaScript file.

This isn't very convenient
